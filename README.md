## THP W11D2 - Developer track - Back to Javascript (same player plays again...) !

### :one: Content :scroll:

- **Exercice 1 :** Same as for the W11D1 first exercise but avoiding classic loops (for, while... No problem, did not use them! And forEach... not much difficult as "map" can be an exact equivalent here)

- **Exercice 2 :** See above. Not a challenge actually...

- **Exercice 3 :** See above. Not hard, even forEach had already disappeared at this stage...

### :two: How to :bulb:

1. Create an empty directory on your :computer:
2. Clone the current :octocat: repository to the latter
3. Launch the "index.html" file (no local web server should be needed)
4. Have super fun :satisfied: with the proposed genuine approach to solve the different exercises

_NB: be sure to check your brower's console to see :eyes: some of the (somehow hidden) results of the above :wink:_
